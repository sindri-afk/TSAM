Hello group 34! To get the secret phrase, reply to this message 
with a UDP message where the payload is an encapsulated, valid UDP IPv4 packet, 
that has a valid UDP checksum of 0x9468, and with the source address being 116.236.164.154! 
(Hint: all you need is a normal UDP socket which you use to send the IPv4 and UDP headers possibly with a payload) 
(the last 6 bytes of this message contain the checksum and ip address in network byte order for your convenience)
